CloudOps Starter Kit

Azure/AWS Infrastructure Monitoring & CI/CD Practice Project

Overview

CloudOps Starter Kit is a beginner-friendly DevOps project created to simulate the day-to-day responsibilities of a fresher DevOps Analyst in an enterprise environment. The project focuses on foundational cloud operations, monitoring, access management, CI/CD basics, and structured documentation using Azure or AWS.

Objective

The objective of this project is to gain practical exposure to cloud and DevOps fundamentals by assisting with routine setup, monitoring activities, troubleshooting observation, and documentation. The project mirrors how junior DevOps engineers support senior teams while following standard operating procedures in real-world organizations.

Project Description

In this project, basic cloud infrastructure such as virtual machines, storage services, and networking components were provisioned using Azure or AWS. User access was configured using cloud IAM services with appropriate permission levels. Monitoring dashboards and alerts were set up to track system health, CPU usage, memory consumption, and storage utilization.

Common cloud issues such as virtual machine startup failures and resource quota limitations were observed and documented to understand troubleshooting workflows. A simple CI/CD pipeline was implemented to deploy a sample application to a cloud virtual machine. Operational documentation was created to capture setup steps, daily health checks, and troubleshooting observations.

Tools and Technologies

The project was implemented using Azure or AWS cloud platforms along with Git and GitHub for version control. CI/CD pipelines were created using GitHub Actions or Azure DevOps. Linux fundamentals were used for server interaction, while Azure Monitor or AWS CloudWatch handled monitoring and alerts. Basic Bash or PowerShell scripting was used where required.

CI/CD Workflow

Whenever code is pushed to the GitHub repository, the CI pipeline is automatically triggered. The pipeline performs build and validation steps and then deploys the application to a cloud virtual machine. Deployment status and logs are monitored to ensure successful execution.

Monitoring and Operations

Daily operational activities include checking virtual machine health, reviewing monitoring dashboards, validating alert status, and inspecting logs for anomalies. A predefined checklist is followed to ensure consistent and reliable cloud operations.

Documentation

Strong emphasis was placed on documentation throughout the project. Setup guides explain how cloud resources are provisioned, access management steps describe IAM configuration, and daily health check documents outline routine operational tasks. Troubleshooting notes capture observed issues and escalation steps.

Learning Outcomes

This project provided hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure fundamentals, DevOps operational workflows, monitoring and alerting tools, CI/CD pipelines, and enterprise-style documentation practices. It helped build confidence in supporting cloud operations in a structured team environment.

Future Enhancements

The project can be extended by introducing infrastructure automation using Terraform, adding advanced monitoring alerts, implementing approval-based CI/CD stages, and integrating basic security compliance checks.

Conclusion

CloudOps Starter Kit helped me develop a strong foundation in cloud and DevOps concepts while working within structured processes, checklists, and documentation standards commonly followed in enterprise IT operations.
